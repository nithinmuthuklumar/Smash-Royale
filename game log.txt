Button class
locate libgdx drawing class for sprites and override it for centre drawing

create an overhead class for screen to hold skin and stuff cuz txtbutton constructor cannot
the override of the textbutton is working well
add a scale for the words later
Also override the input using ispressing and stuff
learn to use table 
work with viewport to make game size proper
make a parent class for all screens to encompass all related things

Think about SmashRoyaleScreen class for holding everything including screen constants

Lots of oop issues : skin,screenW stuff ,repetitive code in screens; SmashRoyaleScreen is definitely needed
Tommoeow : selection screen,InputListener
understand oop rules
getters or protected

SO
working on character selection - some sort of menu for the character
characters go on bottom 
display current character

tomorrow:
find map 
shorten namespace somehow
start game
get other characters



learn more about abstract and whether fighter should be abstract

have a map class for the different number of lane maps
all choice at menu
Shaperenderer resize is messed up


isanimationfinished can be really useful for animations
viewport is messed up for the stage as well

Ask sirs opinion on try accept vs throws

maybe separate stage for name field because unfocused isnâ€™t working

should the link be abandoned for just fighter 

Have an enemy var that is type player;
	replace it with bot||enemy from server
player will have:
	elixir amount
	troop placement cool down 
	what character they are
bot needs to have access to lane coordinates so it will be passed to it before the battle
I want the game so that p1 is the server
the enemy gets filled with either bot or another player

getPlayer()- the method name is the same as the class so what to do?

textures or texture atlas and just spritesheet
ask sir about the two lines of code that allow transparency
maybe create a Pygame sprite class?
give time for death tomorrow
more precise animation speed; each action should have it's own suitable speed
have an even higher level interface for weapons as well
